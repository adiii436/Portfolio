## üìñ About This Project

This project is a comprehensive personal portfolio designed to showcase my skills, projects, and professional background as a Java Full-Stack Developer. It features a modern, single-page layout with smooth scrolling navigation, a theme toggler for light and dark modes, and a functional contact form powered by EmailJS. The portfolio is built from the ground up with a focus on clean code, reusability, and a great user experience.

## ‚ú® Features

-   *Responsive Design:* Fully responsive layout that looks great on all devices, from mobile phones to desktop computers.
-   *Component-Based Architecture:* Built with reusable React components for easy maintenance and scalability.
-   *Dark Mode:* Includes a theme toggle for switching between light and dark modes.
-   *Smooth Scrolling:* Smooth navigation between different sections of the portfolio.
-   *Contact Form:* A functional contact form that uses EmailJS to send messages directly to your inbox.
-   *UI Components:* A rich set of UI components from shadcn-ui, including cards, buttons, and forms.
-   *Engaging Animations:* Subtle animations and transitions to enhance the user experience.

## üöÄ How It Works

The application is a single-page application (SPA) built with React and Vite.
-   The main entry point is src/main.tsx, which renders the App component.
-   The App component in src/App.tsx sets up the routing and theme providers.
-   The Index page in src/pages/Index.tsx is the main layout, which includes all the different sections of the portfolio (Hero, About, Skills, etc.).
-   Each section is a separate React component, making the codebase modular and easy to manage.
-   The contact form in src/components/Contact.tsx uses the EmailJS library to send form data directly to a pre-configured email address without needing a backend server.
-   Styling is handled by Tailwind CSS, with custom themes and components defined in tailwind.config.ts and src/index.css.
